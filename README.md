# js8call_aprsmessaging_interface

A simple User Interface to send Email and SMS messages into the APRS network using JS8Call

Uses unix os to send the UDP message to JS8Call, adaper from a script by Jason, KM4ACK.

Written for Raspberry Pi Debian Buster, but sould work on other unix builds. 
I'll make a version for windows when I casn figure out the equivilent windows command to send the message
Requires Python3 but may work on older versions.
