# js8call_aprsmessaging_interface

A simple User Interface to send Email and SMS messages into the APRS network using JS8Call

With thanks to Jordan, KN4CRD for JS8Call - http://js8call.com

Uses unix os to send the UDP message to JS8Call, adaper from a script by Jason, KM4ACK.

Written for Raspberry Pi Debian Buster, but sould work on other unix builds. 
I'll make a version for windows when I casn figure out the equivilent windows command to send the message
Requires Python3 but may work on older versions
Install pre-requisites before running:

pip3 install psutil

Ive added a desktop shortcut file in response top some questions.
Download the file to your desktop, edit the file to the correct path to where you downloaded the aprs_msgJS8Call.py app to. Double click on the .desktop file and click on execute or execute in terminal.

Enjoy!
